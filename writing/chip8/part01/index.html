        <h3>Part 1: Development Environment and Hello World</h3>
        <div>
            First things first, we need to configure our development environments and verify that they are working as expected.
            This project could be completed using a variety of toolchains and technologies, but we're going to be using the C++
            programming language with Visual Studio on Windows and GCC on Linux. We'll be using the SDL library to handle input
            and graphics. If you already have Visual Studio and GCC installed and configured, skip ahead to Step 2.

            <br><b>Windows: Setting up Visual Studio 2015 for C++ development on Windows 10</b><br>
            1) Download Visual Studio from <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/">www.visualstudio.com</a>.
            I'll be using the Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition since it is free and does everything we need it to.
            The installation process is lengthy, but fairly straightforward.
            
            Make sure to select "Custom" for the installation type: <br><img src="images/vs_installer.png"><br>
            Then place a checkmark next to the option to install "Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015.": <br><img src="images/vs_installer2.png"><br>
            <br>
            
            2) Once the installation completes, open up Visual Studio. Create a new project, select the "Empty Project" template,
            and name it "Hello World". Select the "Source Files" folder in the Solution Explorer, and press "Ctrl-Shift-a" to add a new item.
            Add a "C++ File" and name it whatever you'd like, I named mine "Main.cpp". Type in the following code for a basic program:
            
            <pre class="sunlight-highlight-cpp">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;

	// Wait for user input. We only do this to keep the cmd window visible.
	int tmp;
	std::cin >> tmp;		
}
            </pre>
            
            3) Press "F5" to build and execute your program. 
            If you see something like the image below, you have a working Windows development environment.
            If you get an error or some other output, start by doing some research on Google. If you still can't get it to work, leave a comment.
