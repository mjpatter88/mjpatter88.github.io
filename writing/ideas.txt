Paso - Step by step, intermediate -> advanced programming series
Chip8 - Series on how to develop a Chip8 emulator. (Should I move SDL article out of here?)


Misc:

1) "The most challenging part of programming is conceptualizing the problem." - Code Complete p.12
	Use Project Rosalind - Problem IPRB.py(Mendel's First Law) as an example of this.

2) The Project Rosalind PROT.py(Translasting RNA into Protein) problem helped me learn
   the utility of Python's zip and map functions. It reinforced the utility of list/dict comprehensions.
   Step through this program, starting with basic for loops and ending with my solution.
