Work Experience:
Rockwell Collins – Summers 2006-1010 Cedar Rapids, Iowa
As a technical intern, I developed and tested software for satellite communication systems.
I set up and maintained hardware in specific testing configurations,
generated detailed testing documentation and cross-linked it to requirements using DOORS,
and wrote software to automatically generate Python test scripts based on a user's input.

Research at Iowa State University – 2010-2013 Ames, Iowa
As both an undergraduate and a graduate researcher, I surveyed the current research in the hardware security field.
I worked with the GNU Radio and the USRP to investigate electromagnetic emissions from keyboards,
developed and tested Physically Uncloneable Functions (PUFs) in VHDL, and discovered several
vulnerabilities in modern GPUs. View my M.S. Thesis at http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/13115/.

Teaching at Iowa State University – 2010-2013 Ames, Iowa
As an undergraduate teaching assistant, I taught two semesters of “Advanced Programming in C and C++.”
